# Navigation System using Floyd's Algorithm
Introduction:
The objective of this project is to develop a navigation system using Floyd's algorithm that calculates the shortest distance between two locations. The system will provide users with the shortest path by distance and time, allowing them to select their preferred mode of transport.

Functionalities:
The navigation system will access a database that contains information about cities, streets, houses, and other relevant data.
Users will input their starting and ending locations through the console.
The system will use Floyd's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance between the two locations and provide users with the shortest path by distance and time.
Users can choose between traveling by car or public transport.
If users select public transport, the system will display the specific transport to take, where to change, and other relevant information.
The system will use DAO interfaces, MyBatis, connection pool, Git, and Jira.

Technical Details:
The navigation system will be developed using Java and SQL.
The system will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
The database will be accessed using SQL queries.
The system will use the MyBatis framework to interact with the database and provide an abstraction layer between the application code and the database.
The system will use a connection pool to manage database connections efficiently.
Git will be used for version control, and Jira will be used for issue tracking and project management.

Conclusion:
The navigation system developed using Floyd's algorithm will provide users with the shortest path by distance and time, allowing them to select their preferred mode of transport. The system will use DAO interfaces, MyBatis, connection pool, Git, and Jira, ensuring that the application is scalable, maintainable, and reliable.
